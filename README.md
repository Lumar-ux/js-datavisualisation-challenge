# JavaScript Challenge: Data Visualization 

Welcome to my "Data Visualization" challenge repository! This project was a 5-day solo consolidation exercise completed as part of my JavaScript training.

## Project Overview

My mission: transform a basic HTML article into an engaging, interactive experience using JavaScript. I was tasked with adding two types of data visualizations:

1. **Inline Data Visualization:** Take existing data tables within the HTML and dynamically create interactive graphs above them.
2. **Real-Time Remote Data Visualization:** Fetch data from an external API ([https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php](https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php)) and display a live-updating graph.

**Key Technologies & Concepts**

* **DOM Manipulation:** Selecting and modifying elements to insert the graphs.
* **Third-Party Libraries:** I chose to work with [Toast UI Chart](https://github.com/nhn/tui.chart) for this project.
* **Problem-Solving:** Breaking down the project into manageable steps and designing a logical solution.
* **Debugging:** Using the console to identify and resolve issues.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Ensuring the article is accessible even if JavaScript is disabled.

## How It Works

## Challenges & Learnings

* **Learning Curve:** Getting familiar with the charting library's features and API took some time.
* **Data Manipulation:** Transforming the raw data into the correct format for the graphs was an interesting puzzle.
* **Real-Time Updates:** Ensuring smooth updates without performance issues was a key consideration.
* **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling for API requests was essential.

## Future Improvements

* **Enhanced Interactivity:** Adding more user interaction options (e.g., filters, tooltips) would enrich the experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Making the visualizations adapt well to different screen sizes.
* **Custom Styling:** Applying custom styles to the graphs to match the overall article design.

## My Reflections

This challenge reinforced my JavaScript skills and gave me valuable experience working with data visualization libraries.  The project also highlighted the importance of careful planning, problem-solving, and clean code.
